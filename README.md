 **House Price Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression** 
 
- **Project Title**: House Price Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

- **Objective**: Developed a predictive model to estimate house prices based on features such as square footage using **Simple Linear Regression**.

- **Dataset**: Utilized a dataset with 4600 records and 18 features, including house attributes such as `sqft_living`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `floors`, and `price` (target variable).

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, converting dates to datetime format, and selecting relevant features for the model.

- **Feature Selection**: Chose `sqft_living` as the independent variable to predict the dependent variable `price`, simplifying the regression model.

- **Train-Test Split**: Divided the dataset into an 80% training set and a 20% test set using **Scikit-learn** to evaluate the model on unseen data.

- **Model Implementation**: Implemented a **Simple Linear Regression** model using **Scikit-learn** to establish a relationship between square footage and house prices.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluated the model using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)** to assess accuracy and model performance.

- **Visualization**: Created visualizations of the regression line and compared actual vs. predicted prices, providing insight into model accuracy and fit.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and data visualization.
